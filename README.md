Nice to meet you, I’m @HarryHelsing

After many years of experimenting with Linux I decided to learn my first
programming language, Rust, in 2023. The way it elegantly combined safety,
speed, reliability, and usability still fascinates me to this day, though
the learning curve is intense!
In July 2025 I decided to go from hobbiest to full time in developing my
skills. With the aim to learn Linux Systems Administration.

I'm hoping to combine and refine my growing skills in Linux and programming
to become a proficient System Admin. Though I am refining with this goal in
mind I am open to exploring many side goals and projects to keep my
perspective and skills fresh and flexible.

Current experiments include:
- Making a language learning note taking CLI tool to help with my Italian
- Making my own LAN server with AlmaLinux

Previous experiments of mine include:
- Making simple Rust CLI tools
- Creating some weird and wonderful bash scripts
- Making a game in Rust with Bevy
