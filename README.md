Iâ€™m @HarryHelsing

Currently I'm working on my own game in Bevy called Gahara. (repo name Emerge)
It's built with Rust and the Bevy game engine and is in the early prototyping phases.

Gahara is a well paced 2D strategy/action game about exploring the wilds.
It's based on a grid system and blurs the lines between turn-based and real-time.

I've been learning Rust and programming for nearly two years as a side project.
I have never programmed before this, other than a little Bash usage in Linux which
I switched to a few years ago.

If you want to comment upon my code or ask questions about Bevy feel free.
I'm both happy to share the little I know and receive advice on improving my code.
