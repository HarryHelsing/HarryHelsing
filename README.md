Iâ€™m @HarryHelsing

I've been learning Rust and programming for nearly two years as a side project.
I have never programmed before this, other than a little Bash usage in Linux which
I switched to a few years ago.

I have tried my hands at a range of things, creating a game in Bevy (Rust),
creating a language learning CLI tool, and a few other strange projects.

If you want to comment upon my code feel free.
I'm both happy to share the little I know and receive advice on improving my code.
